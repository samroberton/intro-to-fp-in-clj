# Before the workshop

## 1. Install Clojure

If you're on a Mac, then:

    brew install clojure

On Linux:

    curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.9.0.397.sh
    chmod +x linux-install-1.9.0.397.sh
    sudo ./linux-install-1.9.0.397.sh

On Windows, you can try the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or use a VM that runs a
real operating system.


## 2. Run it

In this repo, run:  `clj`

It will take a little while to come up, while it downloads some dependencies.
Eventually, you'll see a prompt:

    Clojure 1.9.0
    user=>

You're now in a (very basic!) Clojure REPL, which is where we'll be playing
around in the workshop.

You can just hit Ctrl-D at this point to exit.
